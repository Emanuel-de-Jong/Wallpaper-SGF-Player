# Wallpaper SGF Player
Auto play Go matches as your desktop background. So you can get stronger a few glances at a time. Or just for the aesthetic.

The auto play speed can be changed with the numbers on the bottom left. You can also pause it to look through the moves and try out sequences yourself. Wallpapers can't register clicks. So scrolling through the tree is done by hovering over the big grey bar(s).

You need Wallpaper Engine to make it work. Install it and get the SGF player [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3160167480). You can change the SGF player's settings in the Wallpaper Engine window. Settings include changes in the player's behavior and visual customization like changing certain colors.
